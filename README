The idea of this project is to replace Oh No Robot, who seems to have problem, no more maintenance, and which is really closed.

It should be both possible to use it by installing it on one's website or by making a server for many comic.

Hopefully, the task he would do would be:

-If the comic is transcribben: write the text in the page for search motor
-Else ask the reader to transcribe it
-Ask the admin to validate OR
-Ask two other reader to validate/edit it (and so on)

-import (and export) Oh No Robot's database.
